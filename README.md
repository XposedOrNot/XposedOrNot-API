## What is XposedOrNot API?

XposedOrNot is like your personal guard against data breaches. It's a platform that warns you when your email account might be at risk because of a public data breach. Knowing about these breaches can help you reduce the chances of your data getting exposed. Plus, it's totally open-source so you can see exactly how it works.

The XposedOrNot API is the heart of this system. It's what makes the checks for data breaches and sends you the alerts. 

And guess what? It's FREE. 

It gives you all the details about any data breaches that it finds, plus some useful stats about an email.

The API was built and is maintained by Devanand Premkumar.

## How to Use XposedOrNot API (documentation)


If you want to get more details, you can check out our full [documentation](https://beta.XposedOrNot.com/api_doc) and [API playground](https://xposedornot.docs.apiary.io/).

## Why use XposedOrNot API?

XposedOrNot API is the power behind XposedOrNot, and it's the first open-source tool that monitors and alerts you about data breaches.

This API is your go-to for all information related to data breaches that XposedOrNot has collected and keeps up-to-date. Here are some things you can do with it:
- Look up whether an email address has been caught in a data breach and get some stats about it
- See if an email address has been exposed in public pastes
- Do a combined search to check both data breach and pastes exposure for an email address
- Check for exposed passwords without having to reveal who you are

If you'd rather skip the API and check data breach info directly, you can do that on our website at : https://beta.XposedOrNot.com.


## How secure is XposedOrNot API?

Is XposedOrNot API safe to use? Absolutely.

You see, the whole issue of data breaches has come from places that aren't secure. So, we've made sure everything is open-source, including the API and all related files on Github. We trust in the power of open source tools to make our digital world safer.

Everything we run, from the app to the website, is built on open source - from the operating system (Linux) to the API script (Python), and even the web files (HTML). We believe in improving services through collaboration, and open source makes that possible.

We've designed the XposedOrNot API with safety at its core because we're dealing with sensitive data breach information. Tools like Black, Pylint, and SonarQube Community Edition support the security of our code and design elements.

If you spot any problems or have suggestions for improvements, please raise an issue on GitHub.

And if you want to contribute, we welcome your pull requests. We'll gladly consider any changes or fixes you suggest.

## Installation & pre-requisities

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get this API working.

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y google-cloud-sdk google-cloud-sdk-app-engine-python python3-pip google-cloud-sdk-app-engine-python build-essential libffi-dev python-dev 
```

The requirements.txt file should list all Python libraries XposedOrNot depend on, and they will be installed using:


```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all the needed requirements and libraries using pip3.

Before running XposedOrNot-API, you need to, either:

-   [Run local Google DataStore emulator](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/tools/datastore-emulator)
    and debug using the local emulator rather than directly connect to Google DataStore. 
    

```shell
# For posix platforms, e.g. linux, mac:
gcloud beta emulators datastore start
```

-   [Authenticate to Google DataStore](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/auth/application-default) and directly debug using Google DataStore.
